            " Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a transformative force in healthcare. It is being used to improve diagnostics, treatment personalization, and operational efficiency. Despite these advances, the integration of AI in healthcare also raises concerns around data privacy, regulatory challenges, and the need for human oversight. Click here to read the full report on the state of the AI industry in the U.S. and around the world at CNN.com/ Artificial Intelligence and CNN.co.uk/ArtificialIntelligence.  AI benefits can be maximized while risks are minimized, experts say. It is essential to ensure that AI benefits are maximized and risks are minimised, they say.
